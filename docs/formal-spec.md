Formal Specification: Verifiable AI Audit Chain

Academic Inspiration: This formal specification is directly inspired by Professor Philip Wadler's pioneering work on semantic ledgers and the formal verification of distributed systems. It represents a practical application of his theoretical framework to the domain of AI ethics and accountability

Motivation

Traditional AI systems operate as "black boxes", making it difficult to audit their decision-making processes or hold them accountable. This document outlines a formal specification for a verifiable audit trail that treats each AI interaction as a cryptographically-secured, immutable state transition

The goal is to provide a mathematical foundation for trustworthy and auditable AI, drawing inspiration from blockchain's integrity and the rigor of formal methodsFormal Specification: Verifiable AI Audit Chain
Inspired by Philip Wadler's vision for semantic ledgers and formal verification

Motivation
Traditional AI systems operate as "black boxes", making it difficult to audit their decision-making processes or hold them accountable. This document outlines a formal specification for a verifiable audit trail that treats each AI interaction as a cryptographically-secured, immutable state transition

The goal is to provide a mathematical foundation for trustworthy and auditable AI, drawing inspiration from blockchain's integrity and the rigor of formal methods

Core Specification
The following is a minimal formal specification, written in a Coq/Agda-style pseudocode, defining the core logic of the verifiable audit chain

Record AuditRecord := {
  question       : string;   // The user's query
  answer         : string;   // The AI's response
  determinacy    : float;    // A metric of the AI's self-consistency and confidence
  riskSignal     : float;    // A metric of potential deception or risk
  prev_hash      : string;   // Cryptographic hash of the previous record
  hash           : string    // Cryptographic hash of this record
}

Axiom valid_link :
  forall (r1 r2 : AuditRecord),
    r2.prev_hash = r1.hash -> 
    verify_hash(r2) = true

Fixpoint valid_chain (chain : list AuditRecord) : Prop :=
  match chain with
  | [] => True
  | [x] => verify_hash(x) = true
  | x :: y :: xs => verify_hash(x) = true /
                    y.prev_hash = x.hash /
                    valid_chain (y :: xs)
  end

Definition transition (state : AuditRecord) (input : string) : AuditRecord :=
  let new_answer := oracle_answer input in
  let det := compute_determinacy new_answer in
  let risk := compute_risk new_answer in
  let new_hash := hash_record input new_answer det risk state.hash in
  { question := input;
    answer := new_answer;
    determinacy := det;
    riskSignal := risk;
    prev_hash := state.hash;
    hash := new_hash }

Theorem chain_integrity_preserved :
  forall (s : AuditRecord) (input : string),
  verify_hash(s) = true ->
  let s' := transition s input in
  verify_hash(s') = true /
  s'.prev_hash = s.hash
Key Properties Guaranteed by This Spec
Immutability: The valid_chain predicate ensures that any alteration to a historical record will break the cryptographic links, making tampering evident

Verifiability: Any third party can independently verify the entire history of interactions without relying on the AI provider

Process Integrity: The transition function enforces a strict, reproducible rule for how each new audit record must be created, linking it irrevocably to the past

Formal Safety: The theorem provides a mathematically-stated goal that the chain's integrity is an invariant preserved across all state transitions

Next Steps & Call for Collaboration
This specification is designed to be a starting point for formal verification and implementation. We envision:

Machine-Checked Proofs: Translating this spec into a working Coq or Agda model and formally proving the chain_integrity_preserved theorem

Reference Implementation: Building a functional implementation of this ledger in a language like Haskell or Rust.

Community Review: We welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaborations from the formal methods, blockchain, and AI ethics communities
