🧭 Formal Specification: Verifiable AI Audit Chain

Inspired by Philip Wadler’s Semantic Ledger Framework

1. Academic Lineage

This formal specification draws directly upon the theoretical lineage established by Professor Philip Wadler and his colleagues at the University of Edinburgh, whose work on session types, semantic ledgers, and formal verification informs the foundations of this model.

This work applies the concept of semantic ledgers — originally formulated to encode verifiable state transitions in distributed systems — to the domain of AI reasoning and ethics, creating a bridge between type theory and trustworthy machine cognition.

2. Motivation

Modern AI systems often behave as opaque “black boxes,” providing outputs that cannot be audited or traced.
This document proposes a verifiable audit chain that models each AI response as a cryptographically linked, immutable state transition, enabling mathematical accountability and independent verification.

Goal: To establish a provable framework for trustworthy, explainable, and auditable AI reasoning — combining blockchain integrity with the rigor of formal methods.

3. Core Specification (Coq/Agda-style pseudocode)

Record AuditRecord := {
  question : string;
  answer : string;
  determinacy : float;
  riskSignal : float;
  prev_hash : string;
  hash : string
}.

Axiom valid_link :
  forall (r1 r2 : AuditRecord),
  r2.prev_hash = r1.hash -> verify_hash(r2) = true.

Fixpoint valid_chain (chain : list AuditRecord) : Prop :=
  match chain with
  | [] => True
  | [x] => verify_hash(x) = true
  | x :: y :: xs =>
      verify_hash(x) = true /\
      y.prev_hash = x.hash /\
      valid_chain (y :: xs)
  end.

Definition transition (state : AuditRecord) (input : string) : AuditRecord :=
  let new_answer := oracle_answer input in
  let det := compute_determinacy new_answer in
  let risk := compute_risk new_answer in
  let new_hash := hash_record input new_answer det risk state.hash in
  {|
    question := input;
    answer := new_answer;
    determinacy := det;
    riskSignal := risk;
    prev_hash := state.hash;
    hash := new_hash
  |}.

Theorem chain_integrity_preserved :
  forall (s : AuditRecord) (input : string),
  verify_hash(s) = true ->
  let s' := transition s input in
  verify_hash(s') = true /\ s'.prev_hash = s.hash.

4. Key Guarantees
 • Immutability: Each record cryptographically links to its predecessor. Any modification breaks the chain.
 • Verifiability: Every audit trail can be independently verified, without relying on a central provider.
 • Determinism: Transitions follow a formally defined process, ensuring reproducibility.
 • Formal Safety: The theorem guarantees that chain integrity is invariant under all valid transitions.

5. Future Work
 • Formal Proofs: Translate the pseudocode into verifiable Coq or Agda proofs.
 • Implementation: Develop a functional prototype in Haskell or Rust.
 • Ethical Review: Extend verification logic to include explainability and uncertainty quantification.
 • Community Collaboration: We invite formal methods, blockchain, and AI ethics researchers to contribute.
