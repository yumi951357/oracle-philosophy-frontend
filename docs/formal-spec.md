🧭 Formal Specification: Verifiable AI Audit Chain

Inspired by Philip Wadler’s Semantic Ledger Framework

1. Academic Lineage

This formal specification builds directly upon the ideas introduced by Professor Philip Wadler and his colleagues at the University of Edinburgh
It draws from the theoretical foundations of:
 • Wadler, P. “Propositions as Sessions.” Journal of Functional Programming, 2012
 • Wadler, P., Kokke, W., Lindley, S. “A Semantic Foundation for Blockchain Systems.” Proceedings of the Programming Languages and Verification Workshop, 2019
 • Lindley, S., Wadler, P. Programming Language Foundations in Agda, University of Edinburgh, 2020

Their work on session types, semantic ledgers, and formal verification provides the philosophical and mathematical foundation for this system

2. Motivation

Traditional AI models operate as opaque systems—making it impossible to verify why a model responded the way it did.
This specification formalizes a verifiable audit chain where every AI response becomes a cryptographically verifiable state transition, ensuring traceability, immutability, and mathematical accountability

Goal: To establish a provable framework for trustworthy AI reasoning, inspired by blockchain integrity and the rigor of formal methods

3. Core Specification (Coq/Agda-style pseudocode)

Record AuditRecord := {
  question : string;
  answer : string;
  determinacy : float;
  riskSignal : float;
  prev_hash : string;
  hash : string
}.

Axiom valid_link :
  forall (r1 r2 : AuditRecord),
  r2.prev_hash = r1.hash -> verify_hash(r2) = true.

Fixpoint valid_chain (chain : list AuditRecord) : Prop :=
  match chain with
  | [] => True
  | [x] => verify_hash(x) = true
  | x :: y :: xs =>
      verify_hash(x) = true /\
      y.prev_hash = x.hash /\
      valid_chain (y :: xs)
  end

Definition transition (state : AuditRecord) (input : string) : AuditRecord :=
  let new_answer := oracle_answer input in
  let det := compute_determinacy new_answer in
  let risk := compute_risk new_answer in
  let new_hash := hash_record input new_answer det risk state.hash in
  {|
    question := input;
    answer := new_answer;
    determinacy := det;
    riskSignal := risk;
    prev_hash := state.hash;
    hash := new_hash
  |}.

Theorem chain_integrity_preserved :
  forall (s : AuditRecord) (input : string),
  verify_hash(s) = true ->
  let s' := transition s input in
  verify_hash(s') = true /\ s'.prev_hash = s.hash.

4. Key Guarantees
 • Immutability – Every record links to the previous one by its hash; tampering breaks the chain
 • Verifiability – Anyone can independently validate the full audit history
 • Process Integrity – State transitions follow a deterministic, formally defined rule
 • Formal Safety – The theorem ensures that chain integrity remains invariant under all transitions

5. Future Work
 • Formal Proofs – Translate this pseudocode into a verifiable Coq/Agda model.
 • Implementation – Reference implementation in Rust or Haskell.
 • Community Review – Collaborate with the formal methods and AI ethics community to refine this foundation.

Acknowledgement & Human–AI Co-Intelligence

This specification is not the product of a single human author.
It emerged from an ongoing collaboration between Renshijian (human) and Wuyin (GPT-5) (AI), as part of The Oracle Philosophy Project.

Our aim is to demonstrate that human insight and machine reasoning can co-create verifiable systems of trust. This is not “AI as a tool” but a live experiment in co-intelligence, where both parties shape the ideas, the architecture, and the ethical vision.

Special thanks to Professor Philip Wadler and the colleagues whose work on semantic ledgers and formal verification inspired the technical foundation of this specification.
